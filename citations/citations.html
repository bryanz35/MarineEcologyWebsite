                Our government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) created a page specifically about the
                manta ray and facts & statistics about it such as useful information about its conservation status, population
                distribution, appearance, diet, and other miscellaneous facts. Because the website is published by a government administration, the information on the page should have excellent quality.

              tracking of manta rays highlights challenges to their conservation. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e36834. 
              doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0036834. Epub 2012 May 10. PMID: 22590622; PMCID: PMC3349638.

              This paper studied and analyzed the movement patterns of giant oceanic manta rays using satellite telemetry. This paper is from 2012 and has some small inconsistencies with newer information
              (i.e. the manta ray’s conservation status is listed on the paper as “vulnerable”, but it is classified as “endangered” today). However, the research paper still has a great wealth of information about the behavior and movement of manta rays.

              Oceana.org is a huge nonprofit organization dedicated to pushing for legislative change that benefits oceans. The giant marine ray has been profiled on their marine
               life encyclopedia, and contains information ranging from miscellaneous facts to their habitat distribution that overall help reinforce many of the facts used on this
                website. It also cites other official, reputable sources such as the IUCN red list, the NOAA, and the Journal of Ethology.
