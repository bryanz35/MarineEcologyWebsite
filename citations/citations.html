                Our government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) created a page specifically about the
                manta ray and facts & statistics about it such as useful information about its conservation status, population
                distribution, appearance, diet, and other miscellaneous facts. Because the website is published by a government administration, the information on the page should have excellent quality.

              This paper studied and analyzed the movement patterns of giant oceanic manta rays using satellite telemetry. This paper is from 2012 and has some small inconsistencies with newer information
              (i.e. the manta ray’s conservation status is listed on the paper as “vulnerable”, but it is classified as “endangered” today). However, the research paper still has a great wealth of information about the behavior and movement of manta rays.

              Oceana.org is a huge nonprofit organization dedicated to pushing for legislative change that benefits oceans. The giant marine ray has been profiled on their marine
               life encyclopedia, and contains information ranging from miscellaneous facts to their habitat distribution that overall help reinforce many of the facts used on this
                website. It also cites other official, reputable sources such as the IUCN red list, the NOAA, and the Journal of Ethology.

              This paper published in 2018 analyzes the movement of the manta ray in a 3-dimensional plane to a great depth. 
              It talks about the specific body parts and methods this species of stingray utilizes in order to perform maneuvers 
              such as banking and doing barrel rolls. This wealth of information was very helpful for our section about the manta ray’s movement.

              Phylogeny of the manta and devilrays (Chondrichthyes: mobulidae), with an updated taxonomic arrangement for the family, 
              Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, Volume 182, Issue 1, January 2018, Pages 50–75, https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlx018

              When we were researching information about the manta ray, we were quite confused because of the inconsistencies 
              in the scientific name; some sources referred to it as  “Manta birostris”, while others claimed it was named 
              “Mobula birostris”. This paper directly indicates that in 2017, biologists merged the two genera because of their 
              genetic identicality. The new, updated name for the genus is Mobula, which is how M. birostris is referred to in our 
              website.
